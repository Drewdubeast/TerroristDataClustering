# TerroristDataClustering
A java program that creates clusters from the given Terrorist Attack data.

## Summary:
We wrote a java program to take data from Kaggle (the terrorist attack dataset up until the early 90s) and parse through the data,
populate objects, and eventually perform a cluster analysis on said objects.

### What we clustered:
We did clusters of countries with these commonalities:
* Same #1 `attack type`
* Same #1 `weapon type`
* Same #1 `target type`
* Same #1 `target sub_type`
